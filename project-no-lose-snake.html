    <p class='introduction'>
      Have you ever played a perfect snake game - where you fill up the
      complete board with your snake? This snake game that I've implemented
      doesn't end up with a loss when you run into a wall or into yourself.
      It only ends if you trap yourself with your own body.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have used a CSS grid layout to make the board of the game. The snake
      simply spawns in the middle of the board when the game is started along
      with a random food piece - where the location is completely random.
      Every time that the snake runs into a wall, it doesn't continue moving.
      It just stops and waits for the user to move it into another direction.
      Same thing goes for when the snake runs into itself, it just stops moving
      and waits for a user input.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have added in a few bonuses like being able to add more food pieces,
      make the snake longer, or completely change the speed of the snake.
      If you want to completely fill in the board, now is your chance.
